# Impression -- Simple PHP templating engine

Extremely lightweight PHP templating engine designed to encorage the MVC design pattern.

Impression is an open source rewrite of the 'EasyTemp' templating engine created in 2008 in order to support the PHP implementation of the TV Application Layer (although it's perfectly suitable for use in other PHP projects).
